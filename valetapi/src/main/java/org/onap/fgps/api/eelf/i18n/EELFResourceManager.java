/**
 * The resource manager is used to retrieve and format resources from pluggable resource bundles and is capable of
 * managing sets of bundles over multiple locales for message skeletons, message descriptions, message resolutions, and
 * just basic resources.
 * <p>
 * Resource Bundles are pluggable definitions of any type of resource that may be needed by the application and can be
 * externalized. In a typical GUI application, for example, resources may be things like icons, bitmaps, cursors, or
 * other graphic character definitions. In many cases, resources are also the messages that are issued by an
 * application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By externalizing the resources, and then providing a mechanism to load different versions of the resources, the
 * application can be made to support multiple different languages and formatting customs. This is the essential
 * mechanism in java to support internationalization (i18n). The key concept in the java support is that of a
 * <em>resource bundle</em>. A resource bundle is a set, or collection, of resources identified by a key, and where each
 * bundle represents a set of the same resource keys but with values specific to a particular language or region. For
 * example, a message with the resource key of "ERROR_123" could have an entry in a US-English bundle as well as a
 * France-French bundle. Bundles are usually identified by both a language and region code, although that is not
 * required. For example, a bundle specifying only the French language would be used for Canada French as well as
 * France.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class supports the loading of multiple types of resource bundles and the formatting of messages from those
 * bundles. A default bundle is loaded based on the server locale for use by server-side implementation. However, for
 * client-side implementations, this resource manager also allows the locale to be specified and a resource obtained
 * from a locale-specific bundle. This allows the code to format messages and resources appropriate to the client, and
 * not just the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This ResourceManager also allows for additional bundles to be loaded to support bundles that may be needed for
 * specific providers or extensions that may be loaded dynamically. In these cases, these provider implementations can
 * request that their bundles be loaded and managed as part of the overall resources. It is important to have each
 * provider or extension identify their resources using unique keys, because the resource manager will format the first
 * resource it finds using the specified key by scanning the bundles. If two (or more) bundles define resources with the
 * same key, the first occurrence found will be used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * lastly, this resource manager has the ability to manage multiple different sets of resource bundles, segregated from
 * each other to support different uses. for example, a set of bundles can be loaded for the messages, while another set
 * can be loaded for the resolutions, and yet another set loaded for the descriptions. this support can be extended to
 * support any number of different sets of resource bundles in the future if needed.
 * </p>
